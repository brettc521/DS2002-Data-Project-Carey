# DS2002-Data-Project-Carey
The program that I wrote for this project takes data on African countries from the Joshua Project API in JSON (benchmark 1) and removes columns with missing values, and adds a new column that give the percentage of non-Christians in each country (benchmark 3.) You can choose the output to be csv or sql database (benchmark 2) which will then be saved to a local file (benchmark 4.)
